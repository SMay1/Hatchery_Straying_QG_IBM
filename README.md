This repository contains scripts used to run a quantitative genetic model to investigate the impact of hatchery strays on wild populations of pink salmon in PWS, Alaska.
This accompanies a manuscript in Royal Society Open Science titled, "Salmon hatchery strays can demographically boost wild populations at the cost of diversity: quantitative genetic modeling of Alaska pink salmon."
Script 1) Code to run an individual-based model in parallel - all model iterations performed in the paper can be run from this script.
Script 2) Code to read in output files generated in Script 1, summarize data, and generate figures used in the paper.
